        A letter from the authors:
      </p>
      <p>
        As members of the technical community, we have all noticed the disparity between men and women within the classroom and in the workplace. According to <a href="https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/if-you-think-women-in-tech-is-just-a-pipeline-problem-you-haven-t-been-paying-attention-cb7a2073b996#.ixlie4ogq" target="_blank">a study done by the Harvard Business Review</a>, "41% of women working in tech eventually leave the field as opposed to just 17% of men". Whether, unconscious or not, the tech industry has a gender bias towards men - <a href="https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/if-you-think-women-in-tech-is-just-a-pipeline-problem-you-haven-t-been-paying-attention-cb7a2073b996#.ixlie4ogq" target="_blank">research</a> found men receive more favorable treatment when it comes to wage negotiation, personality and performance assessments, entrepreneurial pitches, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first question that needs to be addressed is, "Why do we need women in STEM"? The tech industry has seen explosive growth over the past decade, and our lives are more data integrated than ever before. The products and services put out now are better than ever, but they still have room to improve. As an industry dominated by males, the problems and solutions deal more heavily with male interests. That's not to say women are ignored, but only women truly understand the social problems, pressures, and challenges they face. Women make up less than five percent of Fortune 500 CEOs. To ostracize fifty percent of the workforce is debilitating to the entire economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this website is to raise awareness to men and women about the challenges and common misconceptions women face in the tech industry. In particular, the information on this site is highly relevant for computer science, computer engineering, software engineering, electrical engineering, and management of information science majors, as it is very likely they will experience problems stemming from the gender gap at some point in their professional or academic careers. We selected four topics to inform our readers about: mansplaining, feminism, spotlighting, and affirmative action. We believe by raising awareness, people will be equipped to better support women in the technical community. We hope you take away some facts and actionable items from this site that you as a member of our technical community can use to better improve the experiences and make a more inclusive group for women. We believe that the main way that people can improve this problem is through awareness and sensitivity.

	  <h4>Feminism is a very broad term that many people have completely different views and opinions on. Some believe that feminists are horrible, and others stand firmly behind all types of feminists. The purpose of this webpage is not to tell you to side with feminists or their haters but to inform you on the truth about feminism and those who identify as feminists.</h4>

	  <h6>There are many different types of feminism. It is very important to understand the beliefs and goals of the different types of feminism in order to understand feminism as a whole. I have included three of the most common types of feminism.</h6>
	  <ol>
		  <li>Liberal Feminism - Different laws and social norms in place are keeping women down. The current legal system is what is keeping inequality between men and women.</li>
		  <li>Marxist Feminism-Devaluing women is what is keeping them down. They believe that all forms of discrimination go hand-in-hand, so the way to give women equality is by tackling problems in all areas of inequality.</li>
		  <li>Radical Feminism-Biology, gender, and sexuality used to subordinate women. Men having brute, physical force over women is what is causing inequality.</li>

	  <h2>Why do people dislike feminists?</h2>
      <h3>Some people believe that all feminists hate men</h3>
      <p>This is untrue. This is people mistaking feminists with misandrists</p>
      <p>Misandrists vs. Feminists</p>
      <p>A misandrist is someone who dislikes and is strongly prejudiced towards men. A feminist can be a misandrist, but just because someone is a feminist doesn't mean that they must also be a misandrist.</p>

      <h3>People dismissing equal rights as radical</h3>
	  <p>Feminists are just fighting for equal rights, but when certain people do not like this idea of having both men and women on equal playing fields they say that feminism is too extreme. Sometimes the reason for saying this is because those people want to keep the imbalance between men and women. Equal rights is not radical in any way, and fighting for equal rights should not be perceived as extreme.</p>

	  <h3>People believe that feminists are against having families.</h3>
	  <p>Certain people think that feminists are against having the traditional family and raising children. This is not true because feminists are only trying to make it possible that women have the choice to raise a family or do one of many other things. This could include having a career, going to the army, volunteering, or many other possibilities. Feminists are just fighting for women to have the rights to do what they choose just as men have those rights. This does not make them "family haters".</p>

      <h3>Certain people believe that feminists are too easily offended by everything</h3>
      <p>Feminists are not offended by everything. They are questioning the norms that have been in place
      and that involves not just being okay when people make sexist remarks.</p>

	  <h2>My own experience with feminism</h2>
	  <p>Before creating this webpage, I had heard from both sides of the spectrum when it came to feminism. After doing research on feminism though, I realized that I had a few things wrong about feminism, and the research also helped me to solidify some of the ideas that I had correct. I had no idea about the different types of feminism or what they meant. I also did not know about many of the reasons why people are against feminism. Having this knowledge helps me to try to explain to others the truth about feminism rather than irrationally arguing with them, and I hope the same for those reading.</p>

      <p>
        <u><strong style="font-size: 25px">
          Spotlighting Women in Tech
        </strong></u>
        <br>
        <br>
        The number of women in engineering and tech has been stagnant for <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/wmpd/" target="_blank">nearly 20 years.</a> Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.asee.org/papers-and-publications/publications/college-profiles/09EngineeringbytheNumbersPart1.pdf" target="_blank">billions of dollars</a> have been spent and many organizations have been created to address this issue across all age levels. Why is it that after these efforts have been put forth that women only make up <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/wmpd/" target="_blank">20%</a> of undergraduate engineers? A phenomenon that researchers believe to be affecting this is spotlighting.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u><strong style="font-size: 25px">
          What is Spotlighting?
        </strong></u>
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2005.tb00865.x/full" target="_blank">Spotlighting</a> is where women are singled out based on gender in a manner which makes them uncomfortable.
        <br>
        <br>
        Spotlighting is broken into three types.
        <ul>
          <li>Type 1: Overt Sexism: Where women are intentionally singled out.</li>
          <li>Type 2: Tacit Sexism: Where women are subconsciously singled out.</li>
          <li>Type 3: Singling out women with the intention to help them.</li>
        </ul>
        An example of Type 1 spotlighting is a woman we interviewed stating that:
       
        <br>
        <br>
         &ldquo;For most of my career, I was told that I couldn&rsquo;t be that smart, gotten that job, or gotten that grade, it must have been because I was sleeping with someone.&rdquo;
         <br>
        -Ann Adamson a Computer Science Major who graduated in 1985 from the University of Kansas.
        <br>
        <br>
        An example of Type 2 spotlighting would be referring to engineers with only the masculine pronouns such as him or he.
        <br>
        <br>
        An example of Type 3 spotlighting would be the many programs on campuses and companies that are geared towards women. For example, at the collegiate level, there are programs such as Women in Engineering (WIE), Society of Women in Engineering (SWE), and many others. Also, many companies have created similar groups to SWE and WIE for women in the workplace.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u><strong style="font-size: 25px">
          What is the Problem with Spotlighting?
        </strong></u>
        <br>
        <br>
        SWE, WIE and many other similar clubs, have been shown to have a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2005.tb00865.x/full" target="_blank">positive effect</a> keeping women in engineering. However, there is also a negative effect that comes along with creating these clubs. Women may begin to doubt themselves and their abilities and wonder, why do I need so much help? Toni Schmader, a psychologist at the University of British Columbia and Matthias Mehl at the University of Arizona did a study on <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/07/12/156664337/stereotype-threat-why-women-quit-science-jobs" target="_blank">stereotype threat</a>. These psychologists claimed, “When there’s a stereotype in the air and people are worried they might confirm the stereotype by performing poorly, their fears can inadvertently make the stereotype become self-fulfilling”.
        </p>
        I personally am a women in electrical engineering at Iowa State. One day during my class of 150 students, only 10 of which were women, my professor asked me to solve a problem in front of the class. I was unsure of how to do this problem and was struggling to write anything at all for the class. When the professor finally excused me to sit down, the whole class started applauding and laughing. I was initially mortified. I had just proved to my classmates what I thought they were all thinking, ‘she is not very smart’. It took until I figured out the answer to the problem later that week and explained it to some of the students in my class that I believed I was smart enough to be in this class and this major.
        <br>
        </p>
        The extra attention women get in the classroom and in the workplace does not help their success. This attention can make women think that everyone is watching their every move and every mistake. The feeling of belonging is so important in life, and if people don’t feel that they belong in their career, they have a high chance of leaving.
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <u><strong style="font-size: 25px">
          The Solution
        </strong></u>
        <p style="text-align: center">
        <strong style="font-size: 25px">
            <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2005.tb00865.x/full" target="_blank">&ldquo;By rearranging student support services toward prevention, the perpetrators of bias would be spotlighted, rather than women.&rdquo;</a>
            
        </strong>
        <p>
        <br>
        Instead of creating groups that single out the minority group, a better effort would be to create a group that is inclusive to all people and focuses around a common interest. Once this is done, in these groups men and women can discuss together the struggles that women and minorities face in the classroom and workplace. Realizing the potential for change requires that all stakeholders be involved in the discussion. If students are unaware of the overt sexism (e.g., applauding and laughing at their peer for getting the incorrect answer) how will they begin to understand the tacit and paternalistic aspects of sexism that make students question their capability?
        <br>
        </p>
        Safe spaces need to be populated by potential victims and perpetrators of bias through spotlighting. By creating a group with both men and women, the perpetrator will be spotlighted instead of allowing him or her to continue their bias while being unnoticed by others and unaware of their own actions. A true change will not ensue until men and women work together to create equality and the feeling of belonging.

          This article is a great example of how men can be informed of the struggles that women face along with how empathy and awareness of the problem can create a huge stride toward equality and the feeling of belonging.

      <h1>Mansplaining Overview</h1>
      <p>
        <u><strong style="font-size: 25px">
          <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/mansplaining-definition-history" target="_blank">Mansplaining:</a>
        </strong></u>
        <br>
        Explaining something in a condescending or self-righteous manner, especially as a man to a woman. There are two different types of mansplaining, both of which have similar negative consequences. The mansplaining problem can create difficulties in work relationships as well as foster uncomfortable work environments for women in the tech industry.

        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="https://thefantasticstory.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_20150125_122338.jpg"/>
        <br>
        <br>
        Mansplaining can often be a subconscious action for many men in the tech industry. Eliminating mansplaining would help women feel more comfortable contributing thoughts and ideas, leading to more growth and innovation. The goal of the following information is to make men aware of the habits and tendencies to mansplain, as well as providing possible solutions through examples of men who demonstrate this awareness and modify their speech accordingly.
        <br>
        <br>
        <u><strong style="font-size: 25px">
          Two Types of Mansplaining:
        </u></strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Speaking condescendingly with the assumption that you are more knowledgeable than who you are speaking to.</li>
          <li>Dominating conversation with the assumption that your audience is equally interested in the story you are telling.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <br>
      <h1>The Subconscious Nature of Mansplaining</h1>
      <p>
        According to a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/opinion/how-to-explain-mansplaining.html" target="_blank">New York Times article</a>, a history of powerful men being accustomed to occupying a majority of the time and attention during discussion has created the ideal space for an "epidemic of manologues." In other words, they attribute this to a history of men being given more opportunity to lead professional settings. This creates a cyclical effect as women tend to feel required to pose their ideas in the form of questions, seeking opinion, as opposed to their male counterparts who tend to state their ideas as orders or demands.
        <br>
        <br>
        These common attitudes are demonstrative of how this problem can be tough to tackle. Often times men are not aware of their propensity to mansplain. Because it's subconscious many men may feel that they do not contribute to the problem in their own work environment or work relationships. It is important then to increase efforts to make men more aware of the possible ways they contribute to the issue of mansplaining.
      </p>
      <br>

      <br>
      <h1>Examples of Mansplaining</h1>
      <p>
        The mansplaining phenomenon can manifest itself in many different contexts of speech. Kristy Sammis, an entrepeneur and TED talker explains in a <a href="https://byrslf.co/how-to-mansplain-in-6-easy-steps-aeb707e1e3d0#.7vm2yj50l" target="_blank">blog post</a> many different ways men tend to mansplain to women. These include (but are not limited to) the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Calling a woman by her first name when you have no official "rapport" with her.</li>
            <p>
              The author provides a good example to make readers aware of a common difference in how they address men vs. how they address women. How would you speak about the author Ernest Hemingway? Would you call him Ernest, or Hemingway? If you answered Hemingway, as this is the most common way to refer to Ernest Hemingway, you should consider the difference between that tendency and addressing a woman with whom you have no working or personal relationship by her first name. This can leave the person you are talking to feeling disrespected or feeling less-than a male counterpart.
            </p>
            <li>Making assumptions about a woman's age, experience, etc.</li>
            <p>
              Imagine yourself as an employee in the tech industry. All of your coworkers look down on you - consistently suggesting or joking that you only have your job because of your gender, not your experience. Not only is this inappropriate and damaging in a social/emotional sense to your coworkers, but it is often an offense justifying immediate termination. Are you willing to risk the safety of your coworkers and your own career to make the judgments of others related to their experience?
            </p>
            <li>Phrasing your opinion as though it is unquestionably factual - and conversely, responding to a woman's statements as though the facts are merely opinions.</li>
            <li>Commenting on a woman's personal speech characteristics, such as tone, phrasing, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        These are just a few of the many ways men can come across in a mansplaining manner in the work environment. The highly collaborative nature among software engineers in the tech industry provides plenty of opportunity for men to take the stage to explain a feature, bug, etc. and can lead to plentiful mansplaining in the work environment.
        <br />
        <br />
        As college undergraduate students, you are preparing to embark on a career in an industry with plenty of opportunity to interact with others around you. If you catch yourself doing any one of these, it is important to acknowledge how you did it, why you did it, and think about how next time you can change your tone, phrasing, etc. in order to prevent it next time. Not only will this help build and sustain your work relationships, but it will also help YOU maintain a successful career and avoid burnt bridges or termination.

      <h1>Possible Solutions to the Mansplaining Phenomenon</h1>
      <p>
        An article written by <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2012/11/a-cultural-history-of-mansplaining/264380/" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a> provides a few different examples of men who have displayed a high level of awareness of their inability to speak for the experience of women in different contexts. One of their examples shows how Joe Biden calls out Paul Ryan during a debate saying Mr. Ryan couldn't possibly know how a pregnant woman feels about her body. This demonstrates a solid awareness that he is not in a position to make assumptions about the experience of women. There are two sides to the best solution to the mansplaining problem.
        <br>
        <br>
        One side of the solution to the mansplaining problem is to create an environment where men have a heightened awareness of their attitudes, tones, and tendencies. This in turn will lead to creating an environment where women feel more comfortable contributing their ideas. This solution could be approached in a number of different ways. The most effective would probably be seminars and workshops for employees in the tech industry similar to those for sexual harrassment. This would give men the opportunity to learn how their actions can be better understood and appropriately modified to eliminate mansplaining.
        <br>
        <br>
        The other side of the solution to the mansplaining problem is to create opportunities for women to find comfort in contributing their ideas in the workplace. This would start with women having more opportunities for leadership positions in academics. According to <a href="http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/html/icb.topic58474/krupnick.html" target="_blank">this Harvard study</a>, women are generally more comfortable contributing thoughts and ideas when a female figure is leading the classroom. This would help women entering the tech industry to not fear negative consequences of speaking in a work environment.

      <h1>Affirmative Action, Leadership, and Pay</h1>
      <p>
        <u><strong style="font-size: 22px"><a href="https://www.google.com/#q=affirmative+action" target="_blank">Affirmative Action</a></strong></u> - An action or policy favoring those who tend
        to suffer from discrimination, especially in relation to employment or education; positive
        discrimination.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an ideal society, things like race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. would not have an
        impact on the opportunities people can access. However, we don't live in such a world,
        and years of systemic discrimination have kept affirmative action relevant and necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the tech industry, affirmative action is more in line with having the workplace
        population be in line with population percentages for the nation. It's important to have these
        numbers align, because it allows the industry to better understand consumer needs.
      </p>
      <h2>The Current State of the Industry</h2>
        <img src="images/Computing_Occupations_Graph.png" alt="Women in Computing" style="width:354px;height:278px;">
      </br>
        <img src="images/Occupation_Decline.png" alt="Occupation Decline" style="width:354px;height:278px;">
        <p>
           Only 25% of computing occupations are held by women, and that number has been steadily declining since 1991. Contrary to popular belief, women are not leaving
           the industry for family-related concerns. Some reasons for their exit include:
           <ul>
             <li>
               <p style="font-size: 20px">Workplace Experiences</p>
               <ul>
                 <li>
                   25% of women never enter the industry, and another 25% left after a few years.
                 </li>
               </ul>
             </li>
             <li>
               <p style="font-size: 20px">Uninteresting Work Assignments</p>
             </li>
             <li>
               <p style="font-size: 20px">Dissatisfaction with Career Prospects</p>
             </li>
           </ul>
        </p>
      <h2>The Problem, and Why You Should Care</h2>
      <p>
        Interestingly enough, women don't have too much of an issue <a href="https://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/womenintech_facts_fullreport_05132016.pdf" target="_blank">getting the interview</a>.
        The problem starts after the women start working. According to the National Center for Women & Information Technology, some companies "auto-feed" resumes with female-sounding names into
        the interview pile. This causes a sense of distrust when a woman is brought onto a team, as coworkers can doubt their competencies, thinking she only got the
        job because of her gender. Even experienced women have reported to be at odds with new-hires, as they said they still felt the need to prove themselves in the work place. Once in the field, women face more adversity, and mansplaining is startlingly common.
      </p>
      <p>
        By limiting female opportunity, we are limiting the economy. Startups led by female CEOs struggle to <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2015/02/06/what-silicon-valley-thinks-women-302821.html" target="_blank">secure seed funding</a>. These startups then die out,
        and are never able to take off. Names like Zuckerberg, Kalanick, and Musk are household names now, but there has yet to be a female equivalent. There are some women
        who have made it to a CEO position (for example Marissa Mayer), but they joined the company after it was already worth millions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Venture capitalists point to the lack of female graduates as the reason for fewer women in the work place, but <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2015/02/06/what-silicon-valley-thinks-women-302821.html" target="_blank">a study</a> conducted by Newsweek showed that out of 350
        women, "lack of available advisors" as the top challenge to female entrepreneurship. They specifically state a lack of female leadership makes it hard for them to find professional mentors There are now many initiatives in place to encourage young girls to get into coding, but
        women in industry feel as though there is a lack of resources available to them in the professional world.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's easy to look at women and simply tell them to "man up", but in order for change to happen, men need to take initiative.
        Women in tech worry about coming off as too harsh or too masculine, and their voices get shut out. Since this is a controversial topic, men need to be the ones to invite conversation.
        By equalizing the playing field, we'll have better products, more engagement, and happier workers.
      </p>
      <h2>What Should Be Done?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">Create an Inclusive Culture</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                One of the biggest things that can draw or repel women is the workplace culture.
                Some of the <a href="http://www.catalyst.org/zing/five-things-stem-companies-can-do-attract-and-retain-women" target="_blank">incentives women care about most</a>
                include paid maternity leave, a diverse workplace, flexible work schedules, and
                interesting work assignments.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Men dominate the industry, so it's important to get them on board.
                Since men are more likely to hold key organizational positions such as managers and
                executives, they have a lot of influence on workplace culture.
                It's not so much that men need to "be in charge", but rather they need to be held accountable.

                <a href="https://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/womenintech_facts_fullreport_05132016.pdf" target="_blank">1 in 4 women report that women are often seen as intrinsically less capable than men in their companies.</a>
                This creates an interesting dynamic where if a women goes to ask for a raise or promotion of her own volition, she runs the risk of being cast off as
                brash or abraisive. Also, <a href="https://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/womenintech_facts_fullreport_05132016.pdf" target="_blank">studies</a> have shown that women's
                evaluations contain "2.39 times the amount of references to team accomplishments, as opposed to individual ones".
              </p>
              <p>
                It's important to recognize both team and individual contributions, because they both play large roles in one's career advancements. In traditional tech
                environments, organizations typically keep the promotion requirements to leadership hidden. In a system whose majority consists of male leadership,
                masculine leadership and communication styles are valued more highly.

                - something that changes the basic business system in a way that stopped a pattern of bias in its tracks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bias interrupters are an interesting approach to solving gender problems, since they focus on business practices over changing people. The idea is that
                if business systems change, the people will adapt to fit within the system. An example of a bias interrupter would be adding the words "salary negotiable"
                to a job listing. A contributing factor to the pay gap is that women are less likely to negotiate starting salaries. By adding "salary negotiable" to
                job listings, women were able to close <a href="http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.lib.iastate.edu/ehost/detail/detail?sid=26eafe57-72b4-4d65-9ba5-9f75759c0d34%40sessionmgr4008&vid=0&hid=4105&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=98407154&db=crh" target="_blank">the pay gap by 45%</a>.

      <h2>The Impact of Increased Diversity</h2>
      There have been many different published <a href="https://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/impactgenderdiversitytechbusinessperformance_print.pdf" target="_blank">studies</a> that show the benefits of increasing diversity in the workplace.
      <a href="http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/166220/business-benefits-gender-diversity.aspx" target="_blank">A study conducted by Gallup</a> shows that businesses with a lower gender gap earn on average 14% higher revenue. The same poll stated businesses with higher diversity are more engaged
      with their work, and engaged teams are happier and more motivated than their less-engaged counterparts.
      <p>
        Additionally, men and women tend to have different ideas when it comes to which problems to solve, how to go about doing them, and why they're important. Adding extra
        viewpoints increases a team's overall problem solving skills. Also, as society becomes more diverse, a diverse workplace is key for a companies continued growth as it allows them to interact with new customers and enter new markets.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, air bags became far safer when <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2012-08-22/why-carmakers-always-insisted-on-male-crash-test-dummies" target="_blank">women were consulted in their development.</a> Amazingly, female crash-test dummies
        were not mandatory until 2011. Since airbags were traditionally designed with the male anatomy in mind, they were inherently flawed in that they didn't consider women. Because of this, airbags designed to hit men in the chest were prone to hitting women chin-first,
        thus creating a risk of severe neck and spine injuries. A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2012-08-22/why-carmakers-always-insisted-on-male-crash-test-dummies">study</a> conducted by the University of Virginia’s Center for Applied Biomechanics found that "women wearing seatbelts were 47 percent more likely to be seriously injured than males in similar accidents".
      </p>
      <p>
        As companies continue to promote gender diversity, they can expect to enjoy increased profits, safer products, and more business opportunities. Having more women in the workplace can make a difference in the conceptualization of the user,
        and this helps companies be more customer-focused in their business endeavors. The very nature of the outcome changes when you have people from different backgrounds working together, so companies stand to benefit in a multitude of ways when they include more women.

    <div id="How to Help" class="tabcontent">
      <h1>How you can make a difference!</h1>
      <p>
        The issues women face in the tech industry are broad and scope, but it is possible to make positive changes. Here are a few ways you can help bridge the gender gap!
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>If you're a manager, pay and support women to the same extent as men.</b>
          <p>
            It's not enough for managers to simply push these values onto their employees. Companies that are successful in their
            efforts for workplace equality are famous for dogfooding their values. Leadership should first establish equality as a core value,
            and then push for the organization to adopt and promote equality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, managers need to provide additional support to women to help them pursue their career ambitions. Promoting women to leadership
            roles and giving them leadership tracks to follow will encourage more women to enter the pipeline, as they will start to see value in the
            tech industry as an end-of-career option.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>When you hear coworkers saying "she just got the job because she's a woman", speak up!</b>
          <p>
            No one likes to have their qualifications doubted, and a very common thing women are subjected to are remarks like the one above. This places
            tremendous scrutiny on women, and many feel as though they have to continually prove their competency to their male coworkers. This creates a sense of a lack
            of trust in the workplace, which ultimately affects the workplace morale and team productivity.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Openly discuss diversity and minorities in the classroom and in the workplace.</b>
          <p>
          </p>
          Instead of creating groups that single out the minority group, a better effect would be to create a group that is inclusive to all people and focuses around a common interest. Once this is done, in these groups men and women can discuss together the struggles that women and minorities face in the classroom and workplace. Once everyone is involved in the discussion a true change will start.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Understand what feminists fight for, and inform others on the truths about feminism.</b>
		  <p>
		  </p>
		  <p>
			  The best way to make change is to be as knowledgeable as possible in the area that you are trying to change. When you have this knowledge, you can teach others what you know, and this becomes a domino effect. Make sure to be considerate when you are teaching others and to not force your ideas down others throats. Have a more open-minded approach if you want to be the most effective.
		  </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Be considerate the next time you are learning about feminism and how people are currently fighting for equality.</b>
		  <p>
		  </p>
		  <p>
			  It is always best to listen to where others are coming from when they speak of feminism. Everybody has a different point of view and has encountered different experiences. Take time to listen to where others are coming from whether or not they are for or against feminism.
		  </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Think before you speak.</b>
          <p>
            While this may seem obvious, it's important to remind everyone to think before speaking to help avoid mansplaining.
